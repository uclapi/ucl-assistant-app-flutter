## Contributing

This is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) app so you'll need to install Flutter first.

The Flutter tooling will automatically install dependencies (by running `flutter pub get`) when using VS Code.

Then you can press F5 ('start debugging') when your device is connected to the computer and run the app locally!

## Which API server?

Source code for the UCL Assistant API Server is available [here](https://github.com/uclapi/ucl-assistant-api/). It is hosted at [ucl-assistant.uclapi.com](https://ucl-assistant.uclapi.com)
the `Expo.SecureStore` API.
